# Test de Química (Client)

Welcome to the source code for Test de Química!

This is a project that I did for my high school, [Retamar](https://www.retamar.com). It's a web page to prepare the students for the Chemistry Olympiads. You can [click here](https://test-de-quimica.web.app) to see the web page. Bare in mind that everything about the Chemistry Olympiads (at least for the 2 first phases of the contest) is in Spanish and the students study Chemistry in Spanish, so everything on the web page is in Spanish.

Technically, this code is built as a frame for different web pages. So, there is also a version for [Biology](https://test-de-biologia.web.app) and [Physics](https://test-de-fisica.web.app), although they're not being used at the moment since adding questions takes a while.

This is the client side of the project, you can check the server side in [@iriosarroyo/testDeQuimicaServer](https://github.com/iriosarroyo/testDeQuimicaServer)


#### Disclaimer!
This is my first project in React and Typescript, but as it's a big ongoing project, you'll see some bad coding (and structuring) from when I started, but also a lot of improvement along the way. I go back little by little to that "bad code" and improve it, but at the same time, I also develop some new features.
